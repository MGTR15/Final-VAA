# Introduction

Sailor Shift: From Nobody to Somebody is a visual analytics project that traces the extraordinary musical journey of Sailor Shift, an Oceanus native who rose to international stardom. Starting from humble beginnings in the Oceanus Folk genre, Sailor became a global icon through her genre-blending style, viral hits, and influential collaborations.

This project explores:

-   Who influenced Sailor’s career over time?

-   Who did she influence directly or indirectly?

-   How did Oceanus Folk evolve and shape the wider music world?

-   Who are the next rising stars?

Through interactive dashboards, influence networks, and genre visualizations built using R Shiny, we present insights into Sailor’s impact on music, the genre’s transformation, and the future of Oceanus Folk.
