Starting from humble beginnings in the Oceanus Folk genre, Sailor became a global icon through her genre-blending style, viral hits, and influential collaborations.\nThis project explores:\n\nWho influenced Sailor‚Äôs career over time?\nWho did she influence directly or indirectly?\nHow did Oceanus Folk evolve and shape the wider music world?\nWho are the next rising stars?\n\nThrough interactive dashboards, influence networks, and genre visualizations built using R Shiny, we present insights into Sailor‚Äôs impact on music, the genre‚Äôs transformation, and the future of Oceanus Folk.\n\n\nTeam\nPeng Hsiao Yuan - hy.peng.2024@mitb.smu.edu.sg\nMarga Thura - marga.thura.2024@mitb.smu.edu.sg\n\n\nSoftware & Tools\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nRStudio ‚Äì IDE for R programming and Shiny development https://rstudio.com/\n\n\n\nFrameworks & Dashboards\n\nShiny ‚Äì Interactive web application framework\nshinydashboard ‚Äì Dashboard layout framework for Shiny apps\n\n\n\nData Manipulation\n\ndplyr ‚Äì Data manipulation and wrangling\ntidyr ‚Äì Data transformation and reshaping\nstringr ‚Äì String operations and pattern matching\nreadr ‚Äì Efficient data import and reading\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nggplot2 ‚Äì Grammar of graphics\nplotly ‚Äì Interactive plots\nvisNetwork ‚Äì Network graph visualization\nggraph ‚Äì Graph visualizations with tidygraph support\n\n\n\nNetwork & Graph Analysis\n\ntidygraph ‚Äì Tidy data structure for graph data\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nhttps://thehabaritanzania.netlify.app/\nhttps://wiki.smu.edu.sg/1920t2isss608/Group11_user_guide\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circlize/index.html\nhttps://clauswilke.com/dataviz/\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org//index.html\nhttps://isss608-ay2024-25apr.netlify.app/th_ex/mc1-kickstarter\nhttps://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC1.html"

    "text": "Overview (Project description, motivation, objectives)\n\n\nStoryboards\nThese early storyboard sketches serves as a visual and narrative walkthrough of the user interface (UI) design and analytical features embedded within our Shiny dashboard prototype. It bridges the gap between the data-driven research on Sailor Shift‚Äôs musical influence and the user‚Äôs interactive experience.\nThe purpose of storyboard is twofold:\n\nTo illustrate how different UI components guide the user through data exploration.\nTo explain how specific visualizations, filters, and graphs contribute to uncovering insights about collaborations and influence patterns in the Oceanus Folk music scene.\n\nThe dashboard were designed thoughtfully around three key analytical perspectives:\n\nInfluence Overview ‚Äì exploring how Sailor Shift was influenced throughout her career.\nCollaborators Table View ‚Äì examining who she worked with and who she later influenced.\nInfluence Network Graph ‚Äì mapping the spread of her artistic impact across multiple degrees of separation.\n\n\nPerformer Influence Type Breakdown\nThis tab introduces users to the different influence types that shaped Sailor Shift‚Äôs musical career over time.\n\n\n\nCollaborations Data Table\nThis tab shows artists who collaborated with Sailor Shift by co-performing songs.\n\n\n\nInfluenced Collaborators‚Äô Network Graph\nThis tab visualizes how Sailor Shift‚Äôs songs have influenced Oceanus Folk collaborators across multiple steps of influence.\n\nNetwork graph with three node types:\n\nSailor Shift‚Äôs songs (blue)\nInfluenced songs (yellow)\nCollaborator names (green)\n\nEdge styles:\n\nBlue arrows represent musical influence\nGreen arrows represent song collaboration\n\nEdge labels indicate the number of hops from Sailor‚Äôs song to the influenced collaborator.\n\n\nInfluence Path Filter\nA dropdown below the graph allows users to adjust the depth of influence shown:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDirect Only\nShow only 1-hop direct influences\n\n\n2 Hops\nInclude 1 level of indirect influence\n\n\n3+ Hops\nFull multi-hop influence tracing\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Comparison\nThis tab uses time-series visualizations to compare how Sailor Shift, Kimberly Snyder, and Ping Tian evolved over time.\n\n\n\nPredicted Future Stars\nThis final tab highlights artists predicted to become influential within the Oceanus Folk scene, based on their current trajectory and composite score.\nUI Features:\n\nA ranked table shows the top predicted artist, sorted by final_score.\nColumns: ID, Artist Name, Final Score\nA Select Year dropdown enables users to simulate predictions by future periods or filter emerging talent pools dynamically.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis and Results\nThe analysis and results presented in the Shiny App were derived from the earlier exploration and data analysis conducted in Lester_Take-Home Exercise 1 and MGTR Take-Home Exercise 1. In that exercise, we performed the core influence and collaboration analyses on Sailor Shift and the Oceanus Folk genre, generating key visual outputs and data summaries.\nTo streamline the development of the interactive dashboard, the processed datasets and visual outputs were exported as .rds files. These R data files served as the foundation for the Shiny App‚Äôs dynamic visualizations and dashboards. This approach allowed us to focus on effective storytelling and interactivity in the Shiny App.\n\n\nMeeting Minutes ()"
