# Overview

## Background

-   The story centers on **Sailor Shift**, a global music superstar from the island nation of **Oceanus**. Starting in the local genre **Oceanus Folk**, Sailor's success has significantly boosted the genre’s international recognition and contributed to increased tourism to Oceanus. Her journey from a small band member in **Ivy Echoes** to a record-breaking solo artist highlights her influence on both the music world and her former bandmates, who also continue to shape the genre.

-   Sailor is known for her dedication to **promoting Oceanus Folk and supporting emerging artists**, often through high-profile collaborations. Her evolving musical style has helped Oceanus Folk spread globally, inspiring a new generation of artists.

## Motivation

-   In **2040**, local journalist **Silas Reed** embarks on a project titled *Oceanus Folk: Then-and-Now* to chronicle Sailor’s career and the genre's growth. He has compiled a **knowledge graph** containing detailed data on artists, songs, albums, producers, and musical influences. The goal is to **visualize and analyze this data** to uncover deeper insights into Sailor’s impact and the evolution of Oceanus Folk music.

# Storyboards

These early storyboard sketches serves as a visual and narrative walkthrough of the user interface (UI) design and analytical features embedded within our Shiny dashboard prototype. It bridges the gap between the data-driven research on Sailor Shift’s musical influence and the user’s interactive experience.

The purpose of storyboard is twofold:

-   To illustrate how different UI components guide the user through data exploration.

-   To explain how specific visualizations, filters, and graphs contribute to uncovering insights about collaborations and influence patterns in the Oceanus Folk music scene.

The dashboard were designed thoughtfully around three key analytical perspectives:

-   Influence Overview – exploring how Sailor Shift was influenced throughout her career.

-   Collaborators Table View – examining who she worked with and who she later influenced.

-   Influence Network Graph – mapping the spread of her artistic impact across multiple degrees of separation.

### Performer Influence Type Breakdown

This tab introduces users to the different influence types that shaped Sailor Shift's musical career over time.

### Collaborations Data Table

This tab shows artists who collaborated with Sailor Shift by co-performing songs.

### Influenced Collaborators’ Network Graph

This tab visualizes how Sailor Shift’s songs have influenced Oceanus Folk collaborators across multiple steps of influence.

![](images/Wireframe%20Flowchart%20Whiteboard%20(2).png)

Network graph with three node types:

-   Sailor Shift's songs (blue)

-   Influenced songs (yellow)

-   Collaborator names (green)

Edge styles:

-   Blue arrows represent musical influence

-   Green arrows represent song collaboration

Edge labels indicate the number of hops from Sailor’s song to the influenced collaborator.

### Influence Path Filter

A dropdown below the graph allows users to adjust the depth of influence shown:

| Option      | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Direct Only | Show only 1-hop direct influences     |
| 2 Hops      | Include 1 level of indirect influence |
| 3+ Hops     | Full multi-hop influence tracing      |

### Career Comparison

This tab uses time-series visualizations to compare how Sailor Shift, Kimberly Snyder, and Ping Tian evolved over time.

### Predicted Future Stars

This final tab highlights artists predicted to become influential within the Oceanus Folk scene, based on their current trajectory and composite score.

UI Features:

-   A ranked table shows the top predicted artist, sorted by final_score.

-   Columns: ID, Artist Name, Final Score

-   A Select Year dropdown enables users to simulate predictions by future periods or filter emerging talent pools dynamically.

# Analysis and Results

The analysis and results presented in the Shiny App were derived from the earlier exploration and data analysis conducted in

-   [MGTR Take-Home Ex2](https://isss608-ay2024-2025.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex02/take-home_ex02)

-   [Lester_Take-Home Exercise 2](https://lesteronthecouchisss608.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex02/take-home_ex02)

In that exercise, we performed the core influence and collaboration analyses on Sailor Shift and the Oceanus Folk genre, generating key visual outputs and data summaries.

To streamline the development of the interactive dashboard, the processed datasets and visual outputs were exported as .rds files. These R data files served as the foundation for the Shiny App’s dynamic visualizations and dashboards. This approach allowed us to focus on effective storytelling and interactivity in the Shiny App.
